## Shitty.news
A robot pulls headlines from major news organizations around the internet and creates [markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) out of their headlines to create super shitty news. This was built in about 24hours so pardon some bits of messy code :P

inspired by:
- [/r/subredditsimulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditSimulator/)
- And friends on Twitter

## To build
- cd into project directory
- run `vagrant up` ( You will need vagrant installed )
- This will create your environment running Nginx + Unicorn as well as run all rake and bundle tasks needed
- You can view locally @ `192.168.56.102`
- You can read more about using [vagrant + puppet + nginx & unicorn here](https://github.com/DrewDahlman/vagrant-puppet-boilerplate)
- If front end is your thing check out the `frontend` directory for some hotness there.
