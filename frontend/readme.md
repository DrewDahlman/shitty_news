## Shitty News frontend
This is the frontend of shitty news.

## Run
- cd into project directory
- run `npm install`
- run `bower install`
- run `gulp`

This will start a gulp watcher task that will take all changes made here and place them into the rails pipeline. You can read more about how this works [here](https://github.com/DrewDahlman/gulpRails)
